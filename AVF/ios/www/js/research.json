There is also something to be said for name recognition. As far as payments, a mashup Between The Twitter and PayPal api’s, will allow consumers to trust that that their credit card or checking information remains secure, as well as makes it easier to make purchases, as they don’t have to fumble with trying to enter credit card information on their phone/tablet."],

Then as I would get into the project, would need to go back and reread the research, if I could find it. As a result, what I do now is to keep notes on the research, and keep my links very organized (lots of folders and subfolders). Something I still struggle with is to know when to stop playing with it. Could have a project done for 3 days, but cannot force myself to turn it in, but instead will tinker, tweak and experiment until I ultimately break it and have to then fix in a rush in order to turn in on time. However, this is where most of my debugging skills originated from."]
