<h2>Flag of Portugal</h2>
<img src="images/2649882357_dd3908f956.jpg" alt="Flag" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto">
<br clear="all">
<p>The flag of Portugal has great meaning and rich symbolism. There are several parts to the flag that begin with 2 large vertical stripes. The red stripe, which represents homage to Portugal’s fallen soldiers (blood), takes up 2/3 of the flag while the green (staff side) of the flag takes up 1/3 of the space and represents hope.</p>
<br><br>
<p>In the center of the flag lies a coat of arms, which is seated on a golden armillary sphere. The Armillary sphere is a navigational instrument and pays homage to Prince Henry the Navigator who began the maritime exploration that led to Portugal’s time as a colonial empire.</p>

<br><br>
<p>The coat of arms is incredibly rich in symbolism. The seven castles around the white shield represent the castles that Don Afonso Henriques conquered from the Moors. The white shield with the five small blue shields inside represent the armor of Don Afonso Henriques. Legend tells that Christ appears to Henriques and said “With this sign (white shield), you will conquer”.  The 5 blue shields represent the 5 Morisco kings defeated by Henriques in the Ourique battle. Within each blue shield, are 5 white dots, this represents the wounds Christ received during the crucifixion. The total of the white dots added to the blue shields is 30, this number represents the pieces of silver that Judas received for his betrayal of Jesus Christ.</p>

<h2>Faith</h2>
<img src="images/8263420841_5274f5235b.jpg" alt="Faith" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto">
<br clear="all">	
<p>Approximately 97% of Portugal’s population is Roman Catholic. Their faith is a very large part of who they are as a people. The faith is deeply rooted with government and the origins of such can be traced directly to the founder of the Kingdom of Portugal, Dom Afonso Henriques.</p>
<br><br>
<p>In 1139 prior to the Battle of Ourique, it is said that Christ appeared to the Henriques, who then questioned the Lord:
	“why dost Thou appear to me? Per chance Thou dost desire to give more faith to one who already has so much? It would be better for the enemies to see Thee than I, who since my Baptism have recognized Thee as the true God, Son of the Virgin and the Eternal Father, as I here acknowledge.”</p>
<br><br>
<p>Somewhat differing from other Roman Catholic nations, Portugal does not identify the Catholic Faith with the Priests, Bishops, Cardinals or even the Pope. Although these are very respected offices, they are viewed as people of faith, no different from themselves. So when a mandate is issued from the church, the people of Portugal do not follow blindly, and if it is contrary to what their long held beliefs have taught them, they will pity the Priest, Bishop, Cardinal or Pope, for fear that they have gone astray and should be prayed for.</p>
<br><br>
<p>The Virgin Mother is central in the hearts of the Portuguese people. It is believed that Our Lady is in constant contact with the people through their daily prayers, and is actually viewed to be as close to them as their own families.</p>

<h2>Folklore</h2>
<img src="images/ptg01066942.jpg" alt="Folklore" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto">
<br clear="all">
<p>Stories are passed from generation to generation, celebrated in song and in dance. In Portugal it is a long held tradition to tell the stories of the people through dance. Children are taught from a young age that it is an honor to be a part of the dance, although in modern Portugal, the children often view this as a form of homework</p>
<br><br>
<p>The dances themselves tell different stories, many having to do with the fate of one’s life. The Fado will tell a story that begins with the innocence of childhood, which morphs into the adventure of courting and will end with the a female dressed in black lace from head to toe, to indicate she is now widowed and will spend the rest of her life in mourning.</p>
<br><br>
<p>The reason for performing the dance in costume has changed over time. It used to be that the dance was performed by the village children during festivals. As each collection of villages would hold their festival to honor various saints, it was essential to have something to offer visitors from other villages, as the festivals is how the villages would make money to help sustain them throughout the year. If the visitors were not entertained, they would not spend money or trade goods and the village would suffer. This exercise in reciprocal exchange, is still practiced today, however it has morphed over time. Instead of relying solely upon neighboring villages, it is now a major part of the tourism industry.</p>
<br><br>
<p>In an exercise in transnationalism, these folk dances and festivals are now also held in various nations by Portuguese community centers, in which the children are taught the folk dances and perform during a local Portugal day celebration. The public of the host nation is invited to join in the festivities and monies raised are used to help the local Portuguese community, as well as the communities they are from in Portugal.</p>

<h2>Family</h2>
<img src="images/280020732_d3c740693c.jpg" alt="Family" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto">
<br clear="all">
<p>In Portugal family is an integral foundational part of the social structure. The extended families of cousins, aunts, uncles, grandparents and godparents, as well as close friends are held very closely to the nuclear family.</p>
<br><br>
<p>It is not uncommon to find several generations living under the same roof. Worse case scenario would have family members living very close by. Children are considered such until they have married, and are expected to remain in the home with their parents until wed. Children are also welcomed and indulged, and are expected to take part in most adult activities.</p>
<br><br>
<p>Elderly family members are cared for at home until their death. Generally grandparents will live with their children. The community holds the elderly in the highest regard. It is common for younger generations to show their respect by visiting the elderly after church, even if not a relative. The children will make pastries or fried dough and bring plates of the treats to elderly. During these visits it is common for the older children to tend to the home or garden. Although met with protest, the protest is more a part of tradition, in which the elderly refuse to announce that they are not capable, however the help is welcomed and repaid with the telling of stories and small tokens that have more symbolism that monetary value.</p>
